 ## Design

 ### Colour Scheme
 ![Colour palette](/assets/readme-files/palette.JPG "Colour palette")
* A Simple and refined colour schemes are used.
* Pale backgrounds are used so that image takes center stage.
* Header and footer are bright in colour to distinguishes those sections from other on the page.
* Colour palette was created by using [Coolers](https://coolors.co/).

### Typography

Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:
* Montserrat is used for headings on the site. It is a serif font.
* Nota Serif is used for the body text on the site. It is a sans-serif font.

### Imagery

The images were used with the permission of owner and I have credited these in credit section.

### Icons

I used icons from Font Awesome to encourage users to click on buttons and to add clear visual indicators to sections on the Icecream page and Explore page.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for desktop, tablet and mobile.

## Features

The website is comprised of five pages, four of which are accessible from the navigation menu (home page, icecream page, explore page and contact page). The fifth page is a thank you page which is shown once a user submits the form on the contact us page.

* ### General
  All Pages on the website have:

  * A responsive navigation bar at the top which allows the user to navigate through the site. To the left of the navigation bar is an image of joe jacksons logo together with the text Joe Jacksons Ice Cream. To the right of the navigation bar are the links to the websites pages (home, icecream, explore and contact). To allow a good user experience of the site, Joe Jacksons Ice Cream text is hidden with a media query on mobile devices to prevent the navigation bar looking cluttered. When viewing with mobile devices the navigation links change to a burger toggler. This was implemented to give the site a clean look and to promote a good user experience, as users are used to seeing the burger icon when on mobile devices to navigate a site.

  * A footer which contains address of Joe Jackson Ice cream, social media icon links to facebook and instagram. Social media links open to new page and icons were used to keep the footer clean and because they are universally recognisable.

     ![Screen shot of carousel](/assets/readme-files/carousel-img.png)

    * Scoop Range Section: This section feature button with 'call to actions' that quickly directing user to relevant information on ice cream page.

    * Sundae Bar Section: This section feature button with 'call to actions' that quickly directing user to relevant information on explore page.

    * Contact Section: This section feature  button with 'call to actions' that quickly directing user to relevant information on contact page.

      ![Screen shot of carousel](/assets/readme-files/section-img.png)

      Buttons are consistent in design across the site. Buttons feature a right arrow to encourage them to click and be taken to a new page. Buttons change colour when hovered over. The button text is legible both in its normal and hover state. I have used Bootstrap Button classes, which I have customised in the CSS.

* ### Icecream Page

    * The Icecream and Explore pages features heading and sub-navigation. ID names are used to allow the user to jump to the content. This helps the user to quickly find the section that they are looking for. When hovered on sub-navigation an underline appears underneath the link. This further emphasises that this is a clickable link.Aria-labels are used to make their purpose clear to screen readers.   

    * The first section of Icecream page is scoop section. This section is comprised of listing of scoop and splits into eighteen different variety of scoop. The section uses the same reusable CSS classes from the previous pages to make the information styling consistent with previous pages.

    * The next section is Icecream Cakes, features information about icecream cakes. This section is comprised of listing of cakes and describes two types of icecream cakes.

    * Back to top button appears at the bottom of the Icecream and Explore page and saves the user needing to scroll back up to the top of page. The button features an 'up' arrow, to make it clear that it will quickly send users back to the top of the page.


* ### Explore Page

   This page provides information about Sundae Bar, Millkshake Bar And Chocolate Bar Shake. The section uses the same reusable CSS classes from the previous pages to make the information styling consistent with previous pages, but size of images are different from the previous page.
